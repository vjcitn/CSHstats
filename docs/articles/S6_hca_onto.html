</h3>
<p>In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.</p>
<p>Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.</p>

<p>The <code>ctmarks</code> app: walk through linked ontologies such as PR and present additional facets about the concept in focus</p>
<p>Limitation: the OBO representation in use is outdated and out-links are sparse</p>

<p>Projects: - use rols to get more interesting information about terms into the app - update the ontology resources - go beyond OBO … but not all the way to OWL? Evaluate the UI/UX needed to broaden ontology usage - impacts: data integration, precision of annotation, cognitive efficiency</p>
