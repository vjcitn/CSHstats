For each observation, its 'k'    nearest neighbours are identified using the 'findKNN' function,    based on distances between their expression profiles (Euclidean by    default). An edge is drawn between all pairs of observations that    share at least one neighbour, weighted by the characteristics of    the shared nearest neighbors - see \"Weighting Schemes\" below.     The aim is to use the SNN graph to perform clustering of    observations via community detection algorithms in the 'igraph'    package. This is faster and more memory efficient than    hierarchical clustering for large numbers of observations. In    particular, it avoids the need to construct a distance matrix for    all pairs of observations.
