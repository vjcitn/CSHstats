# CSHstats
R vignettes/pkgdown for elementary statistics for a summer course


One view of the conceptual scheme of the course has three
main vertices:

Most students start at the lower left vertex and need to move along
the bottom edge to work with high-dimensional data generated by
sequencing technologies.

Ultimately we want to use data to climb up the edges to expand biological
medical knowledge.  We'll conduct an
introductory exploration of four topic areas in statistics and
data science:

- Probability and simulation
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Hypothesis testing
- Linear models
- Ontology as a branch of information science
- Brief introduction to convolutional neural nets

TBD: MultiAssayExperiment applications with SingleCellMultimodal (for convenience)
