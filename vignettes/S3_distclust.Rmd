# Road map

- Concepts underlying cluster analysis
    - Distances in high-dimensional spaces
    - Criteria for agglomerative clustering
- Exploring a cluster analysis of copy-number aberration measures in 28 tumors from one patient
    - interactive heatmap
    - comparing Euclidean and correlation (1-cor) distances
    - comparing agglomeration methods
    - the silhouette as a measure of clustering adequacy

# Cluster analysis concepts

The need to identify groups of similar observations arises in
many contexts -- ultimately in the service of clarifying
sources of variability, building power for
statistical comparisons.

Hierarchical clustering of N multivariate
observations is conducted by starting with N clusters and
proceeding from M clusters to M-1 (M=N, ..., 2) clusters by merging
the two members separated by the least of all pairwise distances.

# Application: inferring steps in tumor metastasis in a breast cancer patient

We'll examine data distributed with a [2021 Genome Biology paper](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00989-6) from the Gabor Marth lab.

## A view of copy number aberrations for 1Mb tiling

28 tumors were sampled and sequenced in a rapid autopsy procedure.  Copy number
variation was assessed using [FACETS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027494/).

The tissues from which tumors were taken are Br (Breast), Bo (Bone), Bn (Brain),
Ln (Lung), Lv (Liver), Pa (Pancreas), Ly (Lymph nodes), Kd (Kidney)

<a href="cnv-heatmap.html">A plotly-based visualization</a>

The (vertical) ordering of tissues is chosen to exemplify certain similarities.

For example the block of blue on chr10 is seen for only three samples.
This is an indication of a deletion.

## A cluster analysis proposed in support of the evolutionary map

This code is lightly modified from a script distributed at 
https://github.com/xiaomengh/tumor-evo-rapid-autopsy.git.

```{r doclus}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
 library(csamaDist)
 library(bioDist)
 library(cluster)
})
data(cnv_log_R)
data = cnv_log_R
samples = c('Ln7','Ln9','Ln1','BrM','BrP',
           'Ln11','Ly2','Ln3',
           'Bo3','Ln10','Bo1','Ln8','Lv3','Ln5','Bo2','Bn2','Bn1','Bn3','Bn4','Ln2',
           'Ly1','Ln6',
           'Kd1','Ln4','Lv4','Lv2','Lv1','Pa1')
rownames(data) = samples
d = dist(data, method="euclidean")
fit = hclust(d, method="average")
# the following line changes the order of the samples to produce the Fig.S3B but doesn't change the phylogenetic relationship
fit$order = c(1,4,2,5,3,13,10,20,16,11,12,15,9,17,19,14,18,21,22,7,6,8,25,27,26,28,23,24)
plot(fit)
```

## Drilling down on the clustering

### Comparing Euclidean and Correlation distances

```{r dodists}
cd = cor.dist(cnv_log_R) # from bioDist
ed = dist(cnv_log_R)
plot(as.numeric(ed), as.numeric(cd), xlab="All pairwise Euclidean distances", ylab="All pairwise correlation distances")
```

For a given correlation distance value, there can be wide variation in euclidean distance,
and vice versa.

Open question: What distance metric is most relevant for biological interpretation of CNV?

### A pair with discrepant correlation and euclidean distance values (over entire genome)

We'll have a look at the first 100Mb on chr1.
```{r lk1mb}
plot(cnv_log_R["Ly1",1:100],pch=19, main="chr1, first 100Mb", ylab="FACETS CNV log R", xlab="chr1")
points(cnv_log_R["Ln1",1:100], col="red",pch=19)
legend(60, -.5, pch=19, col=c("black", "red"), legend=c("Ly1", "Ln1"))
#cor(cnv_log_R["Ly1", 1:100], cnv_log_R["Ln1", 1:100])
edist = function(x,y) sqrt(sum((x-y)^2))
edist(cnv_log_R["Ly1", 1:100], cnv_log_R["Ln1", 1:100])
plot(jitter(cnv_log_R["Ly1", 1:100]), cnv_log_R["Ln1", 1:100], xlab="Ly1", ylab="Ln1")
abline(0,1)
```

### Redo clustering with alternative distance and agglomeration method
```{r redo}
fit2 = hclust(cd, method="ward.D2")
plot(fit2)
abline(h=.3, lty=2)
```

### Silhouette measure
 
From ?silhouette with the cluster library:

```
For each observation i, the _silhouette width_ s(i) is defined as follows:

     Put a(i) = average dissimilarity between i and all other points of
     the cluster to which i belongs (if i is the _only_ observation in
     its cluster, s(i) := 0 without further calculations).  For all
     _other_ clusters C, put d(i,C) = average dissimilarity of i to all
     observations of C.  The smallest of these d(i,C) is b(i) := \min_C
     d(i,C), and can be seen as the dissimilarity between i and its
     "neighbor" cluster, i.e., the nearest one to which it does _not_
     belong.  Finally,

                   s(i) := ( b(i) - a(i) ) / max( a(i), b(i) ).         
     
     'silhouette.default()' is now based on C code donated by Romain
     Francois (the R version being still available as
     'cluster:::silhouette.default.R').

     Observations with a large s(i) (almost 1) are very well clustered,
     a small s(i) (around 0) means that the observation lies between
     two clusters, and observations with a negative s(i) are probably
     placed in the wrong cluster.
```

```{r init}
ct1 = cutree(fit2, h=.3)
c2 = cnv_log_R
rownames(c2) = paste(rownames(c2), as.numeric(ct1))
sil = silhouette(ct1, cd)
plot(sil)
```

### Exercises

**1: install bioDist and vjcitn/csamaDist.  Use the code:**

```{r tryck,eval=FALSE}
library(csamaDist)
data(cnv_log_R)
hc1 = hclust(dist(cnv_log_R[1:8,]))
hc2 = hclust(bioDist::cor.dist(cnv_log_R[1:8,]), method="ward.D2") 
opar = par(no.readonly=TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(4,3,1,1))
plot(hc1, main="Euc, complete")
plot(hc2, main="1-Cor, Ward's D2")
par(opar)
```

**Comment on the qualitative differences between the clusterings**.

**2: Here is how to produce a report on silhouette measurement for the
second clustering.**

```{r dosil2, eval=FALSE}
assn =  cutree(hc2, h=.25)
plot(silhouette( assn, bioDist::cor.dist(cnv_log_R[1:8,])))
```

**Produce a three-cluster partition from `hc1` and obtain
the silhouette display.**
